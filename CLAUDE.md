# CLAUDE.md - riddl-models

This file provides stable reference documentation for Claude Code when working
with the riddl-models repository.

**Important**: Read ../CLAUDE.md for general protocols and instructions on
working on Ossum Inc. project which are described in that file; this is one of
them.

## Project Overview

**riddl-models** is the canonical repository for example RIDDL models and
reusable patterns. It serves as a library for AI-assisted RIDDL development,
providing:

1. **Reusable Patterns** - DDD/Reactive patterns (event-sourced entity, saga,
   projector, etc.)
2. **Domain Examples** - Industry-specific RIDDL models organized by sector
3. **Best Practices** - Idioms, conventions, and anti-patterns documentation
4. **Metadata** - Structured metadata for model discovery and categorization

## Model File Structure

Each model directory contains:

```
commerce/e-commerce/shopping-cart/
├── shopping-cart.conf            # riddlc configuration
├── shopping-cart.riddl           # The RIDDL model (domain entry point)
├── shopping-cart.bast            # Binary AST (generated by sbt bastify)
├── types.riddl                   # Shared types
├── Cart.riddl                    # Entity definitions
├── CartContext.riddl             # Main bounded context
├── external-contexts.riddl       # External systems
├── shopping-cart.metadata.json   # Model metadata (optional)
└── README.md                     # Human-readable explanation
```

### NAICS Codes in READMEs

Every model README includes a `## NAICS Code` section near the top
with the closest NAICS industry classification code. The repository
uses BLS sector/subsector decomposition which doesn't map perfectly
to NAICS, so codes are approximate best-fit matches.

### Metadata Schema

Model metadata files follow this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Shopping Cart",
  "description": "E-commerce shopping cart with add/remove/checkout",
  "author": "Ossum Inc.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tags": ["e-commerce", "cart", "checkout", "beginner"],
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "riddl_version": "1.0.0",
  "simulation_ready": true,
  "related_patterns": ["entity/event-sourced", "saga/checkout"],
  "complexity": "standard"
}
```

#### Complexity Tiers

Models can include a `complexity` field to indicate suitability:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `starter` | Simplified version for SMB (fewer entities, basic workflows) |
| `standard` | Full-featured for mid-market |
| `enterprise` | Advanced features, integrations, compliance |

---

## Patterns Directory

The `patterns/` directory contains reusable RIDDL pattern templates:

### Available Patterns

| Pattern | Directory | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Event-Sourced Entity | `entity/event-sourced/` | Entity persisting changes as events |
| Aggregate Root | `entity/aggregate-root/` | Entity managing child entities |
| Saga | `saga/distributed-transaction/` | Multi-step process with compensation |
| Repository | `entity/repository/` | Persistence and query capabilities |
| Projector | `projection/read-model/` | CQRS read-optimized views |
| Process Manager | `workflow/process-manager/` | Event-driven workflow coordination |

Each pattern includes:
- `template.riddl` - Parameterized RIDDL template with `{Placeholders}`
- `README.md` - When to use, how to customize
- `example.riddl` - Concrete example instantiation

---

## Conventions

### File Naming

- RIDDL files: `kebab-case.riddl` (e.g., `shopping-cart.riddl`)
- Metadata files: Match RIDDL filename with `.metadata.json` suffix
- README files: Always `README.md` (uppercase)

### RIDDL Style

Follow these idioms when writing RIDDL (canonical form as of
riddlc 1.13.1 prettify):

1. **Use `is` keyword** for readability: `entity Order is { }`
2. **Use `???` for placeholders** - empty bodies not allowed
3. **Commands use imperative** - `CreateOrder`, `ShipProduct`
4. **Events use past tense** - `OrderCreated`, `ProductShipped`
5. **Always add `briefly`** descriptions
6. **Use explicit states** - avoid flag-based state machines
7. **Type IDs as `{Name}Id`** - `type OrderId is Id(Order)`
8. **Colon field syntax** - `fieldName: Type` (not `fieldName
   is Type`)
9. **Postfix optional** - `Type?` (not `optional Type`)
10. **Markdown descriptions** - `described as { |text }` (not
    `described by "text"`)
11. **No commas** between aggregate fields

### RIDDL Syntax Reference

**Description Syntax** — canonical form uses `described as` with
markdown pipe syntax:

```riddl
described as {
  |Markdown text here.
  |Second line of description.
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The `|` character consumes everything to end of
line including any `}` on the same line. The `}` must be on its
own line.

**Naming Collision Avoidance**:
- Enum values and state names in the same scope cannot match
- Use suffixes like `State` or `Status` to disambiguate
- Example: enum `DeliveryFailed` vs state `DeliveryFailedState`

**Field Overloading (riddlc 1.8.0+)**:
- The same field name cannot appear with different types across a
  context scope (including `Type` vs `optional Type`, `many Type`
  vs `many optional Type`)
- Fix by renaming with semantic prefixes:
  - `status` → `orderStatus`, `paymentStatus`, etc.
  - `amount` → `paymentAmount`, `refundAmount`, etc.
  - `reason` → `cancellationReason`, `holdReason`, etc.
  - Query filter fields → `filterStatus`, `filterEndDate`, etc.
  - Optional variants in state → `updatedCompletedAt`,
    `currentBooking`, `assignedDriver`, etc.

**Repository Handlers**:
- Repositories handle **commands**, not events
- Use `on command Entity.CreateEntity`, NOT `on event`
- Event-to-command name mapping: `EntityCreated` → `CreateEntity`,
  `EntityUpdated` → `UpdateEntity`, etc.

**"to" Adaptor Handlers**:
- Must reference the **target** context's command types
- Use `on command TargetContext.CommandName`, NOT source events

**Projector Handlers**:
- Projectors handle **events** to build read models
- Do NOT use `on command` or `on query` in projector handlers

**External Contexts**:
- Mark external bounded contexts with `option is external` in the `with` block
- NOT inside the context body

```riddl
context PaymentGateway is {
  // events and types only, no handlers
} with {
  option is external
  briefly "External payment processing system"
}
```

**Messaging**:
- Use `tell event X to entity Y` for entity-to-entity messaging
- Use `tell command X to entity Y` for command dispatch
- `send to outlet` is only for streamlet flows

**State Transitions**:
- Use `morph entity X to state Y with command Z` for state changes
- The `with command` provides the data source for the new state

### Directory Naming

- Sectors: `kebab-case` (e.g., `natural-resources`)
- Subsectors: `kebab-case` (e.g., `oil-gas`)
- Models: `kebab-case` (e.g., `well-management`)

## Validation with riddlc

**Validation is integrated into `sbt compile`** — running `sbt compile`
automatically downloads riddlc and validates all 187 models. The MCP
server can still be used for querying grammar, idioms, and patterns.

### sbt Tasks (via sbt-riddl Plugin)

The build uses the **sbt-riddl** plugin (`com.ossuminc:sbt-riddl`)
which provides all riddlc integration. Configuration in `build.sbt`:

- `riddlcVersion` — Version of riddlc to download (currently 1.13.1)
- `riddlcSourceDir` — Set to `baseDirectory.value` (repo root) so
  the plugin scans all sector directories for `.conf` files
- `riddlcConfExclusions` — Excludes `patterns/` from scanning
- `riddlcValidateOnCompile` — Wires validation into `sbt compile`

```bash
sbt compile           # Downloads riddlc + validates all + compiles
sbt riddlcValidate    # Validate all models
sbt v                 # Short alias
sbt riddlcBastify     # Generate .bast for all models
sbt b                 # Short alias
sbt riddlcPrettify    # Reformat all models with prettify
sbt r                 # Short alias
sbt riddlcParse       # Parse-only (no validation)
sbt riddlcInfo        # Show riddlc build info
```

The riddlc binary is cached in `~/.cache/riddlc/` (shared across
projects). To update riddlc, change `riddlcVersion` in `build.sbt`
and re-run — the new version downloads automatically.

### BAST Files

Each model has a `.bast` (Binary AST) file alongside its `.riddl`
source. These are generated by `sbt bastify` and committed to the
repository. BAST files enable fast loading without re-parsing and
are used by tools like riddl-mcp-server and synapify.

To regenerate all .bast files after model changes:

```bash
sbt bastify           # Regenerates all 187 .bast files (~4s)
```

**Round-trip verified**: All 187 models pass full round-trip
verification with riddlc 1.10.2 (unbastify, binary comparison,
and prettify+flatten source diff).

### BAST Round-Trip Verification

A reusable script verifies .bast round-trip fidelity. Run after
any riddlc upgrade or .bast format change:

```bash
./scripts/verify-bast-roundtrip.sh      # all 187 models
./scripts/verify-bast-roundtrip.sh 10   # first 10 (spot check)
```

Three checks per model:
1. **Unbastify** — .bast → .riddl (catches deserialization bugs)
2. **Binary round-trip** — prettify+flatten original to single
   file, bastify that and the unbastified .riddl from the same
   path, compare .bast byte-for-byte
3. **Source round-trip** — prettify+flatten both original and
   unbastified .riddl, diff text AND compare bastified output
   (catches semantic loss)

### Manual Validation

Each model directory has a `.conf` file:

```hocon
validate {
  input-file = "model-name.riddl"
}
```

```bash
# From the model directory
riddlc from model-name.conf validate
```

### riddlc Location

riddlc is available via:
- **sbt** (automatic): `~/.cache/riddlc/{version}/bin/riddlc`
  (downloaded by sbt-riddl plugin)
- **Homebrew**: `brew install ossuminc/tap/riddlc`
- **Staged build**:
  `../riddl/riddlc/jvm/target/universal/stage/bin/riddlc`

Current version: **1.13.1** (set via `riddlcVersion` in
`build.sbt`).

### Model Include Structure

Break models into separate files using `include`:

```
model-directory/
├── model-name.conf           # riddlc configuration
├── model-name.riddl          # Domain entry point with includes
├── types.riddl               # Shared types
├── Entity1.riddl             # Entity definitions
├── Entity2.riddl
├── Context.riddl             # Main bounded context
├── external-contexts.riddl   # External systems (option is external)
└── README.md
```

The main `.riddl` file uses `include "filename.riddl"` to compose
the model.

## Contributing Models

### Adding a New Model

1. Choose the appropriate sector and subsector
2. Create a directory: `sector/subsector/model-name/`
3. Create the configuration file: `model-name.conf`
4. Add the main RIDDL file: `model-name.riddl`
5. Break into separate files using `include` for types, entities, contexts
6. Add README.md explaining the model's purpose
7. Validate with `riddlc from model-name.conf validate`
8. Optionally add metadata: `model-name.metadata.json`

### Model Quality Checklist
